* Requirements and Organization
Please refer to [[https://github.com/bricked-up/requirements][requirements]] (for specifics see the *backend* directory).

* Endpoints
 All communication between the [[https://github.com/bricked-up/frontend][frontend]] and backend will take place over HTTP. The body of the request and the response will be a ~string~. If a more complex struct of information is required, JSON will be used. In the case of *failure* the response body will contain an error message (~string~) on the relevant error.

 Here are the HTTP response codes we will use:

  | Status Code | Event                                                         |
  |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  |         200 | Ok                                                            |
  |         400 | Invalid request                                               |
  |         401 | Unauthorized (client lacks permission to access the endpoint) |
  |         405 | Method not allowed (e.g. using GET instead of POST)           |
  |         500 | Error in the server (e.g. server crashes)                     |

 *NOTE*: "Request" and "Response" are from the perspective of the server.
