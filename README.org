* Requirements and Organization
Please refer to [[https://github.com/bricked-up/requirements][requirements]] (for specifics see the *backend* directory).

* Endpoints
 All communication between the [[https://github.com/bricked-up/frontend][frontend]] and backend will take place over HTTP. The body of the request and the response will be a ~string~. If a more complex struct of information is required, JSON will be used. In the case of *failure* the response body will contain an error message (~string~) on the relevant error.

 We will be using the standard HTTP codes to signify if the request succeeded or not.
